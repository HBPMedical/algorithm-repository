            The form ‘first:second’ indicates the set of terms obtained by taking the interactions of all terms in ‘first’
            with all terms in ‘second’.
            The specification ‘first*second’ indicates the _cross_ of ‘first’ and ‘second’.
            This is the same as ‘first + second + first:second’"
